Dark Deeds is a custom game mode for Dota 2, built with the [Dota 2 Workshop Tools](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools), based on the original Dark Deeds for Warcraft III by Weevilman and StarCraft II by TrenchaunT.

## Map Briefing

> You are a farmer in a land full of strife. You are forced to run away from the village and live elsewhere, for one of the other farmers have become evil, and wants to kill you... Trust no-one, for evil comes in many different forms and is good at hiding itself... Your closest ally may have become tainted with evil, and you wouldn't know... Build a farm and create an army to fight the evil in this desperate time. Ally with people who you know are innocent, fight evil in the daytime and hide in your farm at night... when the evil emerges...
